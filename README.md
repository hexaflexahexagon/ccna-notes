# CCNA Notes

A collection of notes made with the intention of studying for the CCNA certification. I originally took these on paper of the course of a little over a year so the quality may vary, but I'll do my best to clean them up as I transcribe them. 

## Organization

All markdown files can be found in the `notes` directory. Each folder contains a 'module' name which is loosely how my notes were organized historically, though some of these are more or less useful ways of dividing things than others so some changes will be made. 

## Feedback

I am open to any feedback or suggestions! Simply create an issue in the GitHub repository to note any typos, change requests, etc.
